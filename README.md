# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

The purpose of this challenge was to explore the capabilities of JavaScript and HTML for mapping data. Leaflet was used to plot GeoJSON files on a variety of maps using different types of markers, data layers, and mapping skins. 

The GeoJSON was sourced from the US Government, showing earthquake data for the previous 7 days. Markers were created on a map visual showing the relative magnitude of earthquakes in their geographical area. The map allows users to directly compare this with borders for tectonic plates, to get strong insights into the relationship between tectonic plates, and earthquake frequency and magnitude.
